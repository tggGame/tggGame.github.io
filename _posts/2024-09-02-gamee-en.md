**Gamee** is a zero-cost mini game that is currently in its early stages, with relatively simple gameplay mechanics. Since the project is still ongoing, there is a high probability of rewards being distributed upon its completion. The key feature of this game is that it allows zero-cost participation, though it is possible to invest money—this is not recommended. Therefore, players can simply log in during their free time to play the game and earn rewards without any financial investment. Below are some tutorials on how to play the game.

### Game Logic

The core of the game is to accumulate points to earn rewards. But how do you earn points? The simplest way is by playing a parkour-style game to collect points. Here are the details:

1. During the parkour game, you can collect two types of items: yellow four-sided stars and red diamonds.
2. Yellow four-sided stars provide points, while red diamonds can be used to upgrade and increase passive mining capabilities.
3. The speed of the car in the parkour game and the number of items on the field can be increased by upgrading the car (each parkour session is time-limited).
4. Passive mining can also earn you points, and red diamonds can be used to speed up the mining process.
5. Completing tasks can also help you earn more points.

### Game Interface Overview

**Main Interface**

This is the main interface of the game. The functionality of each button is explained below:

1. The yellow star in the upper right corner represents the points you need to collect.
2. Red diamonds can be used to speed up passive mining.
3. The `UPGRADEFQR` button on the left side allows you to increase the passive mining speed by inviting friends.
4. The `UPGRADEFQR` button on the right side speeds up passive mining using red diamonds earned in the game.
5. The rocket ×10 button on the left side allows you to increase the number of parkour attempts through in-game purchases (not recommended for zero-cost play).
6. The `DRAW` button on the right side allows you to participate in a lottery using tickets earned in the game (worth trying).
7. The `LEVEL UP` button in the lower left corner allows you to upgrade the car in the parkour game by inviting active users.

### Upgrading Passive Mining

**Speeding Up Passive Mining**

This is the interface for upgrading passive mining. The image shows the current mining speed of 2 points per hour. Each active user you invite adds an extra 10 points per hour.

This is the interface for speeding up passive mining using red diamonds. As you accumulate enough red diamonds, you can upgrade the mining speed. The initial upgrade requires 20 diamonds, then 50, and so on. Therefore, it’s recommended to participate in the parkour game frequently to collect red diamonds and accelerate your passive mining speed.

### Task Section

**Complete Tasks to Earn Rewards**

This section displays simple tasks such as following other channels or Twitter accounts. After completing these tasks, click to claim your reward. It is recommended that you complete as many tasks as possible, based on your ability.

### Invite Friends

**Invite Friends to Earn Points**

You can earn points by inviting friends. For each friend you invite, both you and your friend will receive 500 points. The more friends you invite, the more rewards you will earn.

### Rewards Section

**Lottery Rewards**

At the start of the game, you are given a free lottery spin, where you can win game tickets and USDT rewards. I won 1 USDT on my first spin, which was quite a pleasant surprise! Once you accumulate 10 USDT, you can withdraw it. Even better, you can participate in the lottery every day.

### Strategy

To quickly accumulate points, it is recommended that you first complete all available tasks to maximize your points. Then, use the game tickets you’ve earned to participate in the lottery. Next, prioritize collecting red diamonds in the parkour game to increase passive mining speed. Finally, although staking mining and NFT mining are additional ways to earn points, they require a financial investment and are therefore not recommended for zero-cost players.
