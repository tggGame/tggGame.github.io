Crazy Camels Mining is a task-based game where you can earn rewards without any investment. Currently, the in-game currency hasn’t been launched with a withdrawal feature, and the game is still in the mining phase. However, since the game is promoted by Venom's official channel, there is a high chance that withdrawals will be enabled in the future. So, for now, players can focus on earning in-game currency. Below are some tutorials on how to play this game.

### Main Game Logic
The core idea of the game is mining. But how do you mine? It all depends on how far the camel runs, which correlates with:

1. Water resources, which control how long the camel can run at a time.
2. Speed, which determines the mining rate.
3. Items, which can be fed to speed up mining, usually doubling the mining speed. This is tied to upgrades but is time-limited, and the time duration also depends on the upgrade level.
4. You can earn more coins by completing tasks and then use those coins to upgrade your equipment.

Below are the three menus of the game:

</div>

### Main Mining Interface
The first menu is the main mining interface. The first row shows the current mining amount, the second row displays the remaining items, which are used to increase mining speed by feeding the camel. The third row shows the mining speed, which, in my case, is 21 coins per second. The fourth row indicates the remaining mining time, which is related to water resources—the more upgraded the water resource, the longer the camel can run each time.

### Upgrading Equipment
The second menu is for upgrading resources.

<div align=center>

</div>

This interface is for upgrading the three pieces of equipment. Each level corresponds to different equipment capabilities. For example, with level 22 water resources, the camel can run for 13,500 seconds each time, which is 3.75 hours. With level 15 speed, you can mine 21 coins per second, and with level 9 items, you can have 3 periods of 95 seconds with double mining speed.

So, whenever you have coins, make sure to upgrade your equipment. The more you upgrade, the more coins you can mine per second.

### Earning Coins by Completing Tasks
The third menu is for earning coins by completing tasks.

<div align=center>
    <img alt="crazy-camels-task" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tggGame/tggGame.github.io/assets/images/crazy-camels-task.webp" width="70%">
</div>

In this screenshot, I have almost completed all the tasks. It's best to complete all the tasks here. Usually, the "follow" tasks require you to follow other channels. You can just follow them and then return to claim your rewards. Some tasks require you to invite friends or reach a certain number of mining sessions. For those, you will have to complete them on your own after finishing all other tasks.

### Earning Coins by Inviting Friends
The last menu is for earning coins by inviting friends. The more friends you invite, the more mining speed you will gain from them. First-level friends provide you with a 10% mining speed bonus, and second-level friends provide you with a 2.5% bonus. Isn’t that exciting?

<div align=center>
    <img alt="crazy-camels-invite" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tggGame/tggGame.github.io/assets/images/crazy-camels-invite.webp" width="70%">
</div>

That concludes the entire game tutorial.

### Tips and Strategies
To help you earn more coins faster, I suggest prioritizing the upgrade of your mining speed. You can manage mining time by frequently collecting, and also complete all tasks. The third item doesn’t need upgrading initially. Once your mining speed reaches around level 15, you can start upgrading the mining time.
